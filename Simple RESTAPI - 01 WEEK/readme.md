MySQL CRUD API with Node.js & Express
This project is a lightweight RESTful API built to handle core database operations using Node.js and Express.js. Unlike projects that rely on an ORM (like Sequelize), this API interacts directly with a MySQL database using raw SQL queries, demonstrating a strong grasp of relational database logic and manual data handling.

Key Features
Full CRUD Functionality: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for database records.
Raw SQL Implementation: Direct execution of SQL commands to manage data, ensuring high performance and query transparency.
RESTful Routing: Organized API endpoints built with Express to handle standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Database Connectivity: Seamless integration between the Node.js runtime and MySQL server using the mysql2 driver.

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
